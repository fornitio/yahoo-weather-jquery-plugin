This plugin allows you to display the location, the current temperature, the current low temperature, the current high temperature, a weather icon.

The plugin uses [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [bootstrap css](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) and [weather themed icons inspired by Font Awesome and ready for Bootstrap](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/).
